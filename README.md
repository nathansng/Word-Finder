# Word_Finder

Word Finder is a collection of Python functions that will find words created from letters entered. 

The functions are under the file Word_Finder.py. english_words.json is a dictionary of all English words. english_words_dataset.py converts the dictionary into a dataframe containing the words and the count of each letter found in the corresponding word. The values of the dataframe is stored in the file english_words_letter_count.csv. There is also a csv file storing the letters and the corresponding Scrabble point.

### Future Goals
- Make a useable website/UI for users to search words up based on letters
